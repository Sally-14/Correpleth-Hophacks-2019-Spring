# Correpleth 

Correpleth combines custom geospatial temporal data by correlating two variables, or simply displaying a single variable, and generating a choropleth map per year. Using this tool, one can visualize global climate change correlation with social factors. Moreover, it can easily be adapted for new data.

Data was scraped from multiple government and international databases to compile custom datasets on:

temperature (1901-2015)
rain fall (1901-2015)
World Happiness Report (2006-2017)
Infant Mortality Rate (1960-2017)
Programmed data merging applications to combine the datasets from various sources into a uniform standard.

Used ggplot (google maps api) for plotting choropleth coordinate data

Collaborated with Benjamin Albert who focused on data collection and analytics, while I helped look for data sources and built the mapper and GUI.
